- [**MvcCore**](https://github.com/mvccore/mvccore) basic website project template, not designed for full portable build/pack. 
- Project is possible to pack/build with [**Packager**](https://github.com/mvccore/packager) only into mixed modes with PHP 
  package and hard drive, because all assets are not hardly linked for single file build.
- If you want new empty project template for single file pack/build, use [**`mvccore/project-portable`**](https://github.com/mvccore/project-portable)
- Project lists only homepage template content and **it tries to list tables** from MySQL `mysql` database, with `root` login and empty password credentials by `/App/config.ini` if possible.
